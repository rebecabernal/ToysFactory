## Project Diagrams (BBDD)



The diagram we did for the database in **DrawSQL**.

As you can the three tables are interlinked, this one, with a **ManyToMany** relantionship.

## Installation requirements

Before you start to read how to install the project you'll need these requirements:
>[!NOTE]
>If you can't install xampp, look for any other local server that supports **MySQL** and **PHP**
***

1. XAMPP

2. Install Composer

3. Install NPM in Node.js

4. Xdebug (for the tests coverage)

5. Postman
***

## :scroll: Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
 https://github.com/rebecabernal/ToysFactory.git
```

2. Install **Composer** and **NPM**
```
composer install
```
```
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file copying everything inside the existing file .env.example and modify the following lines:
* DB_CONNECTION=mysql
* DB_DATABASE=

4. Create a database in **MySQL**

5. Now go to the VSC terminal and put the following command
```
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
This command will generate all the tables.

6. Open another terminal in **VSC** and put the following command
```
npm run dev
```

7. Open another terminal and run the server with this command
```
php artisan serve
```
You'll see an url that is going to take you to a website.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Be sure that your running npm and the server in **DIFFERENT** terminals, **DON'T** close these two terminals and **DON'T** use other commands in these two terminals.

## :white_check_mark: Tests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's important to test the project so we can check if it works correctly and to do that use this command in the **VSC** terminal:

```
php artisan test
```

<p align="center">This is what you should see after putting the command:</p>

<p align="center"></p>

***

## Coverage

To see the coverage you can use this command at the **VSC** terminal
```
php artisan test --coverage-html=coverage-report
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Everytime that you do new tests you need to put the command above in the **VSC** terminal, so it can update your coverage.
***

This will add a folder called "coverage-report", go to the folder, go to the index.html, and then open with live server. After that you should see this page:
